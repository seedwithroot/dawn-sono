Unfortunately, even big-box retailers have naively fallen prey to the predatory tactics of these companies, which means that even some of the products that line the shelves of your favorite retailers may contain formulas that are not only ineffective, but even hazardous to your health. Supporting these kinds of companies undermines the efforts of our government to facilitate a market that is not only competitive, but more importantly, safe for the American people.\n<br><br>\nEvery time you make a purchase you are casting a vote for the kinds of products and companies you want available, so please be sure to always check the labels of your surface disinfecting products for an EPA registration number and ensure that you are contributing to a safe environment not only for yourself, but for those around you.",
